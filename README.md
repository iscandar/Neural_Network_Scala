# Neural_Network_Scala
it's a simple neural network with perceptron structure
I Tried to create A neural network using the Scala language. The cause of scale: there are no clear examples of how to create a neural network with it. I hope to help someone. all class and functions are in italian. soon i will translate them and i think i will write it is C++ .I did not use any third-part library.
to make this project i use some old books, with examples in other languages.

enjoy with it!
